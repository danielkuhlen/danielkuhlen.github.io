I'm a Doctoral Candidate at the [Research Training Group DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), which is jointly organized by the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/).

My research focuses on democratic backsliding, with particular attention to how performance legitimacy may drive support for authoritarian regimes and policies. In my dissertation project, which is supervised by [Felix Haass](https://felixhaass.de), I examine the effects of authoritarian crime crackdowns on public safety, voters’ behavior, and democratic backsliding. Methodologically, I rely on (quasi-)experimental methods, geospatial analysis, and remote sensing.

Prior to joining DYNAMICS I received my BA and MA degrees from Humboldt University Berlin and studied abroad at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
